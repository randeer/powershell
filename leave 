Hi Jenn, hope you’re well. I’m circling back regarding SL statutory holiday process. Tomorrow we have the May Day and I have already submitted the request. Since Mark is OOO this week, I’m reaching out to your per Sam’s advise. Sam too believe this is approved. So just wanted to check with you for me to move forward with the OOO calendar event/procedure for tomorrow. Thanks!
