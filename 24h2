Hi Mark,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to share our recent findings regarding the upgrade path to Windows 11 version 24H2.

Initially, we attempted to use the same method we successfully used for upgrading Windows 10 (e.g., from 21H2 to 22H2) by running setup.exe with the appropriate command-line switches. However, in the case of Windows 11, this approach did not yield the expected results. Our testing revealed that the upgrade process for Windows 11 is more complex and requires additional parameters and steps, making it less straightforward and ultimately unsuccessful using this method.

As an alternative, we identified a reliable method using Local Group Policy settings to enforce the upgrade to a specific Windows 11 build versionâ€”in this case, 24H2.

Recommended Policy Configuration:
Policy Name: Select the target Feature Update version
Path:
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Manage updates offered from Windows Update

Required Registry Values:
TargetReleaseVersion: 1
(Enables version targeting)

ProductVersion: "Windows 11"
(Specifies the OS product line)

TargetReleaseVersionInfo: "24H2"
(Indicates the target Windows 11 build version)

With this configuration in place, the Windows 11 upgrade process is initiated via Windows Update. During regular update scans, the system will detect the target version and automatically download the necessary components to perform the upgrade to 24H2.
