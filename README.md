In your scenario, you're trying to uninstall the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 x86 Minimum Runtime - 12.0.40664" package silently but there is no `QuietUninstallString` available in the properties you have retrieved. The absence of this property typically means the information about silent uninstallation isn't directly accessible via the installed package details. However, there are still several methods to uninstall the package silently using PowerShell or Command Prompt.

### 1. **Use `wmic` (Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line)**

`wmic` allows you to query installed software and run uninstallation commands. Here's how to do it silently:

1. **Find the Product Code for the specific Visual C++ version:**

   Based on the output you've posted, we can see the `ProductCode` is `{8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E}`. This is the GUID for the installed Visual C++ package.

2. **Uninstall the package silently:**

   Open a **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** window with Administrator privileges and run the following command:

   ```cmd
   wmic product where "IdentifyingNumber='{8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E}'" call uninstall /nointeractive
   ```

   This command will uninstall the package without any interaction. The `/nointeractive` flag suppresses prompts.

### 2. **Use `msiexec` Command with the Product Code**

If you have the product code (which you do), you can use `msiexec`, the Windows Installer command-line utility, to uninstall the package silently:

1. **Run the `msiexec` command:**

   In an elevated PowerShell or Command Prompt window, run:

   ```cmd
   msiexec /x {8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E} /quiet /norestart
   ```

   - `/x` means to uninstall the product.
   - `{8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E}` is the Product Code for the installed Visual C++ runtime.
   - `/quiet` runs the uninstallation silently.
   - `/norestart` prevents the system from automatically restarting after the uninstall process.

### 3. **Use `Get-WmiObject` in PowerShell**

If you prefer working with PowerShell, you can use the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to uninstall the product. Here's how to do it:

1. **Uninstall using `Get-WmiObject`:**

   Run this PowerShell script:

   ```powershell
   $product = Get-WmiObject -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_Product WHERE IdentifyingNumber = '{8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E}'"
   $product.Uninstall()
   ```

   This will uninstall the product silently without needing to specify extra flags, though the uninstallation process itself might not be silent depending on the product.

### 4. **Check the Program's Uninstall String (if applicable)**

Sometimes, even if the `QuietUninstallString` is not available, you may be able to retrieve the regular `UninstallString` and modify it to run silently.

1. **Retrieve the uninstall string:**

   Run the following PowerShell script to look for the `UninstallString` in the registry:

   ```powershell
   $uninstallString = (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{8122DAB1-ED4D-3676-BB0A-CA368196543E}" ).UninstallString
   ```

2. **Modify the uninstall command:**

   Once you have the uninstall string, if itâ€™s something like `msiexec /x {ProductCode}`, you can add `/quiet` or `/norestart` options for silent uninstallation.

### Conclusion:

- **`wmic`** and **`msiexec`** are the most reliable ways to silently uninstall software when the `QuietUninstallString` is not available.
- Use **PowerShell** to query and uninstall, leveraging `Get-WmiObject` or directly running `msiexec`.
