<#
    looking to add an option to stop the device from rebooting automatically?
    unfortunately the tool we're using, the windows 11 install assistant, lacks such a flag.
    the flags we use above - "/quietinstall /skipeula /auto upgrade" - are the only useful flags we could find.
    naturally the documentation for this is poor, but there is no indication of any reboot option.

    (there is "norestartUI" but that doesn't do what you'd think it does.)
