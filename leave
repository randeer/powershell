Hi Jenn,

Thank you for the clarification regarding the process for holiday and PTO requests. I appreciate your guidance on this.

We had submitted our requests through AT two weeks ago, following the advisory that was shared previously. However, to ensure I'm fully align with the correct procedures going forward, could you kindly share the process document for both the Sick and PTO requests?

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to being in complete alignment with the team's processes moving forward.

Best regards,
