Tested windows 11 24H2 upgrade process using personal windows 11 22H2 and Windows 10 22H2.
Use following - Start-Process "Windows11InstallationAssistant.exe" -ArgumentList "/quietinstall /skipeula /auto upgrade /copylogs %temp% /noreboot"
This process does not invove UI, upgrade completed succseesfully

Even though we enable traget TargetReleaseVersion value and force it to windows 
Set ProductVersion to "Windows 11"
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" -Name "ProductVersion" -Value "Windows 11"

and Set TargetReleaseVersionInfo to "24H2"
Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate" -Name "TargetReleaseVersionInfo" -Value "24H2"

Upgrade process does not succeed with "Install-WindowsUpdate" command. only upgrade process works windows update mannual UI option.
